      "Suppose for the moment we *do* have some method of determining when arbitrary ciphertexts are in depth. Given messages with indicators ``ABC`` and ``ABE`` we can slide one against the other until we determine that the overlapping ciphertexts are in depth. In this case we would find that moving ``ABE`` three ahead of ``ABC`` results in ciphertexts which are in depth and so we can infer that the last letter of the key corresponding to ``ABE`` must be three ahead of that corresponding to ``ABC``. Or, to put it another way, if at display setting grundstellung+2 the machine enciphers ``E``$\\rightarrow \\ell_1$ and ``C``$\\rightarrow \\ell_2$ then $\\ell_1$ must be three letters ahead of $\\ell_2$. Since we know that, in this case, the machine at grunstellung enciphers ``ABC`` $\\rightarrow$ ``REQ`` and ``ABE`` $\\rightarrow$ ``RET`` we can confirm our deduction by noting that ``T`` is indeed three letters ahead of ``Q``.\n",
